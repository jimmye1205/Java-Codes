# Java-Codes
Java codes assigned from school

Hello my name is Jimmy Hernandez and I am mainly a Java language programmer but I can easily grasp onto another language (if needed).
These are some of the java programs I was assigned in my first couple years of school attending Cal State LA. As I started taking my upper division 
courses I have experience in some web developement. I have some minor experience in C# since I was not tought I tried to self teach myself the 
language but I also have some experience in python, haskell, and C. I am currently looking for a position to gain some knowledge and field
experience in my major computer science so I can apply what I have learned in school so far while attending my last year at school.

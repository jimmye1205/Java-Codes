# Java-Codes
Java codes assigned from school

Hello my name is Jimmy Hernandez and I am mainly a Java language programmer but I can easily grasp onto another language (if needed).
These are some of the java programs I was assigned in my first couple years of school attending Cal State LA. In my cs2012 file these java codes
are done using Object Oriented Programming where I learned how to organize my programs and also gaining some experience using javafx. In my cs2013
file are more java codes where I learned to Program with Data Structures and how to use linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, skip
lists, and graphs; sorting and searching algorithms; basic algorithm analysis; As I started taking my upper division courses I have experience in
some web developement. I have some minor experience in C# since I was not tought I tried to self teach myself the language but I also have some
experience in python, haskell, and C. I am currently looking for a position to gain some knowledge and field experience in my major computer
science so I can apply what I have learned in school so far while attending my last year at school.
